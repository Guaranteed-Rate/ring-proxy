# ring-proxy

HTTP proxy [ring
middleware](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/a02518275a06835e4fdd1a3af59d7c4c0408d25b/SPEC#L12)
for Clojure web applications.

## Usage

### Dependency

```clojure
[tailrecursion/ring-proxy "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

### Example

Assuming your application's route handler is defined as `routes`, you
may add a proxied route with something like the following:

```clojure
(ns your-ns
  (:require [tailrecursion.ring-proxy :refer [wrap-proxy]]))
  
(def app
  (-> routes
      (wrap-proxy "/remote" "http://some.remote.server/remote")))
```

### Command Line

Suppose you need a local proxy server for some reason (I needed one to be able
to make SOAP requests using Apache Axis2 to a test server whose SSL certificate
was invalid --- there was no easy way to tell Axis2 to pass those arguments to
the HTTP client it uses to make the requests).

```
$ lein run 7000 https://example.com {:insecure? true}
```

You can now make requests to http://localhost:7000/foo/bar, for instance, and
the proxy will relay the request over SSL using the HTTP client options you
provide on the command line.
